# AI agents catalog

## Description

Welcome to the Agent Lab! :)

This repository will serve as a growing collection of AI agents I’ve built, tested, and explored. My goal is to break down how each one works, where the core ideas come from, and how you can build on them yourself—whether you're brand new to AI or just starting to explore the world of agentic systems.

I'll do my best to make everything approachable, with clear explanations, real-world examples, and practical tips. If you're curious about what agentic AI is or want to start creating your own autonomous agents, you're in the right place.
